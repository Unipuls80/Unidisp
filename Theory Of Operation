This board is designed to take care of driving Nixie tubes, and make designing gadgets with these displays easier.

The board contains distinct sections:
1- Input power section with 5V regulator
2- Anode voltage DC/DC converter
3- Driving circuitry for cathodes and anodes
4- Decoders and auxiliary circuits

(1) Input section:

Power is provided by an external unregulated 12V DC source through a barrel jack X1 (center positive). Fuse F1 is a fast fuse for protection against excessive current draw. 
F1 should be rated for the final current draw of this board and your control board combined. In combination with diode V1 it also serves as a revere polarity protection. 
C1 serves as a local filtering capacitor. This unregulated supply rail is available at test point TP1 and X3, pin 7. 

Regulated 5V is provided by a 7805 linear regulator A1 in a TO-3 package. The TO-3 package is chosen so it sufficiently dissipates heat by itself. 
C2 and C3 are decoupling capacitors for A1. Regulated 5V rail is available at test point TP2 and X3, pin 5. Ground is available at TP3 and X3, pin 6.
